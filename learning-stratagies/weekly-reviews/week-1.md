## Week 1
Learning Strategy Review

-----------------------
### What went well
- Recording and recalling processes, rather than trying to remember specific syntax.
- Explaining processes and knowhow to pair partners. This helped identify gaps in my own knowledge that I could later brush up on.
- Taking a good break of a couple of hours when getting home before attempting to do anything programming related.


-----------------------
### Even better if

- Watch more of the supporting videos for tips and advice. **Action:** Bookmark key videos to watch when on train etc.

**Improvement:** Take more breaks which are more effective.   
**Action:** Set deliberate break times and boundaries with pair partners. Try to switch off completely from code for 5-10mins.
