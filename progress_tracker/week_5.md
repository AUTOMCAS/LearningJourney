## Week 4 - The first group project: Engineering project 1


### Goals

1. Learn to work and communicate effectively as part of a team to build a web application.
2. Learn to break down projects into tasks and assign them to pairs.
3. Learn to use agile ceremonies to organise your work and improve your processes.
4. Learn to use the developer workflow to plan, implement and peer-review features.

- Work in **pairs** and as a **group** to complete tickets in each sprint.
- Use git to work on different branches for different features before merging.

### **EVIDENCE**
- Team charter
- Trello board
- Design diagram
- Comments from peers
- Final outcome

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
- From the start we agreed as a group to prioritise learning about the Agile way of working, collaboration and good communication. Focused on this, shifting our measure of success from producing a product to working effectively as a team, our group truly thrived. 

- While hard work, we all enjoyed ourselves and each felt valued in the team.

- Alongside the successes of our working practices, we were all satisfied with our final outcome. 

**Even better if**
- This week was hard to fault and a great experience.
- Given the short amount of time for the project, in hindsight we could have perhaps initially spent less time planning.
