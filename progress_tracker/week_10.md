#### Goal 2: Develop a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good object orientated design skills.
**PLAN**
- While completing technical challenges, focus on process and producing high quality code. 

**EVIDENCE**

- [Bank technical test](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/bank_tech_test)
- [Gilded rose technical test](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/gilded_rose_tech_test)
- Positive code reviews from coaches and peers with constructive criticisms. 
- Clear commit history for each technical test.
- Testing behaviour-first.
--------------------------


### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
- Using diagrams to explore existing code as well as for planning.
- Seeking code reviews from peers  as well as coaches.
- Testing behaviour-first.
- Starting with simple tests.
- Understanding good process and writing good READMEs.


**Even better if**
- Ensure all tests work independently from each other.
- Taking a break then spending a few minutes reviewing final code before submission.
- Better management of taking breaks.
