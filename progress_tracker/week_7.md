## Week 7 - Learning to use JavaScript to build frontend web applications

### Goals

1. Test-drive a simple JavaScript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
2. Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
3. Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.

### **PLAN**

### Goal 1: Test-drive a simple JavaScript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
**PLAN**
- Complete the increasingly complex exercises and challenges to build a simple note taking app.
**EVIDENCE**
- Used TDD to largely complete development of the [Notes app](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/notes-app-paired) frontend application. This web app allows a user to add notes which are stored on a backend server. Notes are retrieved and shown when the page is refreshed.
- Created a diagram to explore [Testing](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/diagrams/web-apps/testing.png)
- Mocking fetch in jest.
--------------------------


#### Goal 2: Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges which explore the manipulation of the DOM in JavaScript.

**EVIDENCE**
- Created a diagram to explore the [DOM](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/diagrams/web-apps/dom.png)
- Development of the [Notes app](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/notes-app-paired) frontend application to allow a user to input and submit a new note. This note is then displayed on the page along with existing notes.

--------------------------

#### Goal 3: Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges which explore the concept of asynchronous programming.

**EVIDENCE**
- Development of the [Notes app](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/notes-app-paired) frontend application which stores notes on a backend server. Notes are retrieved when the page is loaded using a fetch GET request. Notes are created and stored on the backend server using fetch POST.
- Completed the [Github repository lookup](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_7/phase_3/example-4) web app exercises. This web app uses user input and fetch to to retrieve information about Github repositories.

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
- Diagramming to understand how different elements work.
- Seeking help from peers and pairing to solve common issues outside of normal pairing times.
- Using console logs a lot to understand what was going on.

**Even better if**
- Not get so stuck up on initially doing things by the book, eg writing a test, and instead first spend some time to understand what is going on.
