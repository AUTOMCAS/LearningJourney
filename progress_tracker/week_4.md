## Week 4 - Web applications


### Goals

1. Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level.
2. Write integration tests for a web application.
3. Implement web routes using a lightweight web framework.
4. Follow a debugging process for a web application.
5. Deploy a web application using a light cloud service.

--------------------------

### Goal 1: Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers phase one exercises and challenges on HTTP

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed introduction exercises and challenges on requests and responses.
- Produced [diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/tree/main/diagrams/web-apps) exploring requests and responses in depth.

--------------------------


#### Goal 2: Write integration tests for a web application
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges which require integrated rspec tests.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed exercises and challenges including [Hello web project](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_4_web_apps/exercises_and_challenges/hello_web_project)

--------------------------

#### Goal 3: Implement web routes using a lightweight web framework
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges which implement basic HTML, GET requests, and forms to send POST requests.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed exercises and challenges including development of [Music library database app](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_4_web_apps/exercises_and_challenges/music_library_database_app) to include creation of new artists, albums and links to artists and albums by id.

--------------------------
#### Goal 4: Follow a debugging process for a web application
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges on debugging.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed various [Debugging challenges](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_4_web_apps/exercises_and_challenges/debug) looking at general debugging as well as implementing ways to better secure programs.

--------------------------
#### Goal 5: Deploy a web application using a light cloud service
**PLAN**
- Follow Maker's guides on deploying a web app using Heroku.

**EVIDENCE**
- Experimented by using Heroku to deploy [Music library database app](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_4_web_apps/exercises_and_challenges/music_library_database_app).
- Deployed solo weekend challenge to Heroku [Chitter challenge](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/chitter-challenge)

--------------------------

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
- Creating a [diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/tree/main/diagrams/web-apps) to record and explore learning was hugely beneficial. 
- Pairing with fantastic fellow Makers to reveal different methods and solutions.
- Revisiting elements from previous weeks such as database management helped reinforce learning.

**Even better if**
- Made better notes on initial setup and what to initially include in each file to link files together.
- Spent longer exploring debugging.
