## Week 3


### Goals

Based on:
Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

1. Learn to use SQL to create a schema in a database.
2. Learn to use SQL to manage and communicate with a database.
3. Learn to use TDD to design a program which integrates a relational database and implements CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

--------------------------

### Goal 1: Learn to use SQL to create a schema in a database
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges introducing SQL and table schema.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed [Blog challenge](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_3_databases/phase_2/05_designing_schema_two_tables) to design and create table schema using SQL.

--------------------------


#### Goal 2: Learn to use SQL to manage and communicate with a database
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on using SQL to read and manipulate database data.

**EVIDENCE**
- [Design Diagram]() I created to help understand the design process. This was shared with cohort and well received.

--------------------------

#### Goal 3: Learn to use TDD to design a program which integrates a relational database and implements CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on how to setup and build a program which communicates with a database.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed [Social network project](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_3_databases/phase_2/06_test_driving_write_operations.md/social_network)
- Completed [Shop manager project](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_3_databases/shop_manager)
- [Shop manager project Design diagram]()
