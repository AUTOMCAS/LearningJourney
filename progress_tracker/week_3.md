## Week 3 - Databases


### Goals

1. Learn to use SQL to create a schema in a database.
2. Learn to use SQL to manage and communicate with a database.
3. Learn to use TDD to design a program which integrates a relational database and implements CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

--------------------------

### Goal 1: Learn to use SQL to create a schema in a database
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges introducing SQL and table schema.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed [Blog challenge](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_3_databases/phase_2/05_designing_schema_two_tables) to design and create table schema using SQL.
- [Design Diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/diagrams/databases/database.png) I created to help understand the design process. This was shared with cohort and well received.

--------------------------


#### Goal 2: Learn to use SQL to manage and communicate with a database
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on using SQL to read and manipulate database data.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed [Social network project](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_3_databases/phase_2/06_test_driving_write_operations.md/social_network)


--------------------------

#### Goal 3: Learn to use TDD to design a program which integrates a relational database and implements CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on how to setup and build a program which communicates with a database.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed [Shop manager project](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_3_databases/projects/shop_manager)
- [Shop manager project Design diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/diagrams/shop_manager_diagram.png)

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
Creating a diagram to explain the process of creating a database and table schema was hugely beneficial. It enabled me to consolidate knowledge from various sources and build a clear picture of the process. I was able to identify and fill gaps in my own understanding and build a great foundation of knowledge for the rest of the week.

Implementing processes such as TDD with io mocking from previous weeks helped to reinforce understanding.

Paring with somebody with a vastly different approach and way of working was challenging at first as it pushed me away from my comfort zone. However it was rewarding and productive and offered new insight into learning processes.

**Even better if**  
Keep better notes or links on some of the key concepts / information.

Check back to weekly goals for progress.
