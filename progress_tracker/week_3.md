## Week 3


### Goals

Based on:
Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

1. Learn to use SQL to create a schema in a database.
2. Learn to use SQL to manage and communicate with a database.
3. Learn to use TDD to design a program which integrates a relational database. Implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
