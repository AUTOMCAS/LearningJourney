## Week 6 - Learning a new language: JavaScript Fundamentals

### Goals

1. Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
2. Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
3. Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
4. Learn to debug in Javascript.

### **PLAN**

### Goal 1: Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises to learn about functions, callbacks, arrays, objects etc in Javascript.
- Learn by translation. Consider what I know about Ruby and prioritise learning about the most important equivalents in Javascript.

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed exercises and challenges on basic Javascript fundamentals.
- Prioritised learning about:
  - Basic manipulators such as conditionals and loops. [Example](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/blob/main/week_6/phase_1/06_loops/fizzBuzzLoop.js)
  - Methods of storing data such as variables, arrays and objects.[Example challenge](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/blob/main/week_6/phase_1/11_array_operations/personalisedMessagesChallenge.js)
  - Classes. [Basic class creation](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_6/phase_1/12_classes), done as part of a pair.

#### Goal 2: Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges which require test driving using jest.
- Use TDD to complete the **Bowling scorecard** weekend challenge 

**EVIDENCE**
- Testing using Jest. Used TDD to build a [Shopping basket program](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_6/phase_2/03_shopping_basket) where candy can be added to a basket, discounts can be applied and the total basket price can be calculated.
- Used TDD to build a bowling scoreboard from scratch for the weekend challenge. [Bowling scorecard challenge](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/bowling-challenge)

--------------------------

#### Goal 3: Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
**PLAN**
- Complete exercises and challenges which explore the concept of asynchronous programming.

**EVIDENCE**
- Watched good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) on the event loop and created diagram in link below.
- [Event loop and testing using timeouts Diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/diagrams/javascript/eventloop-js.png)
- Completed [Github client](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_6/phase_2/05_calling_apis) challenge which fetches data from an API, stores it in an object and returns it when prompted.
- Attended and was active in a Makers workshop on asynchronous behaviours.

#### Goal 4: Learn to debug in Javascript
**PLAN**
- Complete debugger exercises and challenges.

**EVIDENCE**
- Attended and got actively involved in workshop on debugging.
- Completed challenges on debugging using debugger and console.log. [Debug a quiz completed example](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers_projects/tree/main/week_6/debugging/debugging-javascript) This quiz had multiple errors and did not run. Using VSCode, debugger and console.log I was able to identify all issues and get the quiz to work correctly.


--------------------------

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
- Thinking about how I would solve a problem in Ruby and finding out the equivalent in javascript.
- Attending and being actively involved in workshops, being able to ask coaches questions about live work and working process.
- The weekend challenge, although in a new language, was enjoyable and I did not get too stuck up. I felt I had learned enough in the week to be able to apply familiar ways of working, such as TDD and creating classes, to complete this challenge.

**Even better if**
- Spent more time through the week focusing on understanding concepts that are different in Javascript to Ruby, such as asynchronous programming and using functions as values.
