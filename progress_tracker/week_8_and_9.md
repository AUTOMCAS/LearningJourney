### **PLAN**

### Goal 1: Understand an existing codebase and learn how to work with the unfamiliar technologies used within it.
**PLAN**
- Spend time creating diagrams, watching videos, looking at documentation, seeking coach advice and sharing knowledge as a group.

**EVIDENCE**
- [Diagram to explore the frontend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook/main/planning/diagrams/frontend-codebase-exploration.png)
- [Diagram to explore the backend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook/main/planning/diagrams/backend-codebase-exploration.png)
- Read through documentation and other articles and watched several videos on the new technologies, from introductions to specific key features.
--------------------------


#### Goal 2: Use high-quality processes and practices like Agile to build a project as a team.
**PLAN**
- Create a team charter to outline our routine, what our goals are and how we will deal with any issues and problems.
- Break down features and tasks using sprints, tickets, pairing and code reviews.

**EVIDENCE**
- [Team charter](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook/blob/main/planning/team-charter.md)

- [Layout planning diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatriciaGN/acebook-team-owlpaca/main/planning/diagrams/feed-layout.png)

--------------------------

#### Goal 3: Have fun.
**PLAN**
- Pick a theme and goals we believe in.
- Measure success based on how much we are learning and how we are enjoying the project, rather than feature completion.
- Celebrate successes.

**EVIDENCE**
- Team spirit remained high through the project, despite the frequent challenges.
- We believed in our product and enjoyed talking about it, as evident in our presentation [slides](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook/blob/main/planning/presentation/OwlPacas.pdf) and [video](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook/blob/main/planning/presentation/demo.mp4)




--------------------------

#### Goal 4: Share knowledge as a team.
**PLAN**
- Have frequent code reviews.
- Discuss what we want to learn or share during retros.
- Pair regularly with different people.

**EVIDENCE**
- Daily retros (as outlined in the [team charter](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook/blob/main/planning/team-charter.md)).
- Mini-workshops held within the team to share more complex concepts.
- Diagramming as a team (see any of the diagrams above).
- Pairing daily with different people.


--------------------------

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**  
- Believing in our product.
- Having a well defined team charter.
- Being open with what we were finding hard and where we needed help.
- Regular team meetings to discuss issues and celebrate success.
- Sharing knowledge to keep everyone on the same page.
- Experimenting with new concepts and technologies in isolation.

**Even better if**
- Wrote more tests.
- Spent more time planning features.
