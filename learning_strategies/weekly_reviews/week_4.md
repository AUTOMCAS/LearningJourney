## Week 4 - Web applications
Learning Strategy Review

-----------------------
### What went well
- Drawing diagrams again. This helped identify knowledge gaps, consolidate learning and lay a good foundation for the rest of the week. [Web appplications diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/tree/main/diagrams/web-apps)
- Getting through challenges in good time to allow more time for the solo challenge which was a big one!
- Creating a wide scope [diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/tree/main/diagrams/projects/chitter) for the [Chitter solo challenge](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/chitter-challenge) really helped to plan and spot problems.
- Taking appropriate breaks during pairing sessions.
- Revisiting and implementing content from previous week, particularly databases and SQL. This really helped to solidify knowledge.


-----------------------
### Even better if

- Went outside more.  
**Action:** Make a point of going for a walk on week days.
