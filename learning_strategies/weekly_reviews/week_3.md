## Week 3
Learning Strategy Review

-----------------------
### What went well
- Drawing diagrams based on my own understanding. This helped identify knowledge gaps, consolidate learning and lay a good foundation for the rest of the week. [Database diagram](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/diagrams/database.png)
- When working alone, taking good beaks and switching off from thinking about code. Pair boundaries need improvement.
- Starting to deliberately give and ask for feedback form pair sessions.


-----------------------
### Even better if

- Make creating diagrams to explore understanding a habit.  
**Action:** Use excalidraw to diagram at start of every week to explain new topics and processes.

- To deepen my understanding, make a note of extra things I want to explore for later to deepen my understanding.  
**Action:** Create a place to store a list with links of things I want to explore, for example using let and before in Rspec. - Did not do this well from previous week.

- Set better boundaries with pair partners on breaks and end times.  
**Action:** Set deliberate break times and boundaries with pair partners.
