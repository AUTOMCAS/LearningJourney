## Week 8 and 9 - MERN group project: Facebook clone
Learning Strategy Review

- Timescale: 2 weeks. 
- Group size: 6. 
- Primary technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, Node
-----------------------
### What went well
- Taking the time to learn the codebase using diagramming, looking at existing tests and experimenting with console.logs.
- Learning React and MongoDB through videos, experimentation and sharing knowledge between team members.
- Breaking everything down, from understanding fragments of the codebase to understanding parts of React, to aid in understanding and to prevent feeling overwhelmed.
- Sharing knowledge as a team through mini team workshops, diagrams and code reviews



-----------------------
### Even better if
- Realised sooner the value of taking the time to explore the new technologies along side the codebase before attempting to plan anything new.  
**Action:** Pay more attention to the technologies used in a project and look to explore them if they are new or being used in an unfamiliar way.
