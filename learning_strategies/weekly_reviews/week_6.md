## Week 6 - Learning a new language: JavaScript Fundamentals
Learning Strategy Review

-----------------------
### What went well
- Attending workshops and getting involved in them.
- During one workshop I coded live in front of a coach and members of the cohort. This probed hugely beneficial as I was able to get live feedback not only on the content but also on my process.
- Drawing diagrams as always to help understand concepts.


-----------------------
### Even better if

- Better overcome initial nervous brain block when pairing or working with a coach.  
**Action:** Develop a strategy or process to help my mind kick into gear. Next time it happens to reflect more actively on what has changed to get into a more natural workflow.

- Spend more time understanding important fundamentals when they come up as they are often key to future understanding and learning.   
**Action:** Identify key parts of learning that I am not clear on and find time to review them. I can do this by adding them to my key concept tracker document along with any helpful links or resources.
