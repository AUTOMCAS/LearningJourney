## Week 2
Learning Strategy Review

-----------------------
### What went well
- Becoming very aware that the challenges and exercises provided by Makers offered many opportunities to:
  - Recall knowhow.
  - Repeat application of knowhow within different scenarios.
  - Identify gaps in knowledge.
- Reflecting on parts I felt were particularly challenging.
  - Identifying the specific root of what made it challenging,
  - Identifying gaps in understanding that were blockers to success.
- Meditation


-----------------------
### Even better if

- To deepen my understanding, make a note of extra things I want to explore for later to deepen my understanding.
**Action:** Create a place to store a list with links of things I want to explore, for example using let and before in Rspec. 

- Take more breaks which are more effective. (I did not feel I achieved this from last week)
**Action:** Set deliberate break times and boundaries with pair partners. Try to switch off completely from code for 5-10mins.

- Identify unknown areas of improvement through pair sessions.
**Action:** Make effort to give and receive feedback after pairing sessions.
