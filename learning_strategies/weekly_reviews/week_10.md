Learning Strategy Review

### What went well
- Seeking feedback from coaches and peers on code quality.
- Setting clear daily routines.
- Repetition of the red, green refactor TDD process.
- Diagramming to help break things down and build up understanding bit by bit, as always!

### Even better if

- Improve time management and motivation when working completely alone.  
**Action:** Deliberately having breaks for 5 mins every 25 mins.
