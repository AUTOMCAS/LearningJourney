## Week 5 - The first group project: AirBnB clone
Learning Strategy Review  
The first group project

-----------------------
### What went well
- Embracing that success this week was in learning how to work as a group rather than completing any task.
- Regularly revisiting and re-evaluating group work strategies(such as using sprints) as a group.
- Sharing knowledge between group members to learn new things and make use of different skills.
- Taking regular breaks within the group.
- Working in person.
- Managing energy levels - getting enough sleep, taking breaks and not working evenings.


-----------------------
### Even better if
- Hard to fault as a learning experience.
