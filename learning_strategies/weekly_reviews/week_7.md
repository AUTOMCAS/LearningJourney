## Week 7 - Learning to use JavaScript to build frontend web applications
Learning Strategy Review

-----------------------
### What went well
- Drawing diagrams as always to help understand concepts.
- Pairing outside of normal pairing times to work on common problems.
- Finding help from peers.


-----------------------
### Even better if

- Initially when learning, spending time to experiment and see how things work before writing tests and worrying about TDD.  
**Action:** Don't worry about getting caught up writing tests the first time a new concept is introduced. Instead write a bit of experimental code to get a better understanding of what a test should include.
