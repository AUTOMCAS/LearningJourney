## Precourse Week 4
Learning Strategy Review

&nbsp;

### What went well
- Starting to write questions for review that are about processes or concepts, not just lines of code.
- Added priority column to sort **Review Document** by importance. As I get more confident with the question, the priority decreases.
- Formatted **Review Document** so that I can hide the code column and test myself just against the question.
- Started this Github directory to record this learning journey (previously was on paper)

| Inconsistently using the **Review Document** for review                                                                                              | Set time aside at the end of the day to review key concepts from the **Review Document**|
