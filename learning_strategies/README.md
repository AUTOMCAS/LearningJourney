## Learning Strategies

## Learning how to learn

_Disclaimer: This repo follows an ever changing, dynamic journey of self discovery, reflection and progress. I have tried to introduce order to this chaos through organisation and consistency but I have not always succeeded._

I created a number of resources along this journey bincluding a **[concise and sweet summary version](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/learning_strategies/methods_for_effective_learning.md)**

Before the start of the course I decided that there was no better thing to do than to focus on **learning how to learn**. Coming from a background in Education I had a good idea of how to learn effectively, or so I thought!

I read a number of books on the science of learning and problem solving. I discovered that while I had many good learning strategies, some of which were automatic, I still had a lot to learn about my own effective learning.

Since starting the course I have continued to develop and apply these strategies to Software Development, reflecting and improving my personal learning strategies. This repository is a continuation of this development.

**Included in this repository:**

- A record of my development and implementation of various learning strategies.
- Reflection of what went well.
- Planning what to improve on.
