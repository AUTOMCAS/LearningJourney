### Weekly reflection?

##### REFLECTION AND FEEDBACK
During the first week I was paired with people who were behind me on the challenges.Although I do not have direct evidence, I was able to work with each pair partner and confidently explain most of the key concepts and terminology and help them move forward.This also gave me a great opportunity to reflect on what I had learned, identify gaps in my knowledge and address them.

Initially it seemed a bit odd to start a project by writing tests and no code. However, as I learned more and more about how to implement TDD effectively, I saw how extremely useful it is. It acts as another great way to break down a problem to smaller, more manageable problems and keeps you thinking very deliberately and methodically about what is going on and what your goals are.
