## Weeks 1 and 2
The Golden Square Challenges spanning the first two weeks.
Test-driving, debugging, object-oriented design and pairing.

### Goals
1. Learn to use basic **TDD** best practices.
2. Learn to use basic **debugging** best practices.
3. 
4. Learn to build software as a **pair.**

### Learning strategies (link?) to help in achieving these:
- Create diagrams to aid in understanding.
- Identify and record key processes and principles as I go. (Learning doc link)
- Repeat, recall and test myself on key processes and knowhow.
- Describe understanding and knowledge to others.



#### Goal 1: Learn to use basic **TDD** best practices.
##### PLAN
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on test driving methods, classes and multiple class programs.

##### EVIDENCE
- Completed a challenge to use TDD to design a single-method program. [Link here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/03_design_a_single_method/challenge)
- Challenge to use TTD to design a single-class program. [Link here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/06_design_a_class/challenge)
- [Diagram of how to use *describe*, *context* and *it* in rspec](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/LearningJourney/blob/main/diagrams/rspec-basics.jpg)
- DESIGN METHOD TEMPLATE 
- Videos of my challenge completion.[Link here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/LearningJourney/tree/main/videos/week_1) (include coach feedback?)



#### Goal 2: Learn to use basic **debugging** best practices.
##### PLAN
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on debugging.
##### EVIDENCE
- Learned about Discovery Debugging, completed challenge to debug the Letter Counter program with a pair partner. Used *p* and *binding.irb* to gain visibility. [Link here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/07_intermezzo_debugging_2)


##### REFLECTION AND FEEDBACK
During the first week I was paired with people who were behind me on the challenges.Although I do not have direct evidence, I was able to work with each pair partner and confidently explain most of the key concepts and terminology and help them move forward.This also gave me a great opportunity to reflect on what I had learned, identify gaps in my knowledge and address them.

Initially it seemed a bit odd to start a project by writing tests and no code. However, as I learned more and more about how to implement TDD effectively, I saw how extremely useful it is. It acts as another great way to break down a problem to smaller, more manageable problems and keeps you thinking very deliberately and methodically about what is going on and what your goals are.
