## Weeks 1 and 2
The Golden Square Challenges spanning the first two weeks.
Test-driving, debugging, object-oriented design and pairing.

### Goals
1. Learn to use basic **TDD** best practices.
2. Learn to use basic **debugging** best practices.
3. Explore and use **Object Orientated Programming (OOP)**.
4. Learn to build software as a **pair**.

**Learning strategies (link?) to help achieve these:**
- Create diagrams to aid in understanding.
- Identify and record key processes and principles as I go. (Learning doc link)
- Repeat, recall and test myself on key processes and knowhow.
- Describe understanding and knowledge to others.

--------------------------

### Goal 1: Learn to use basic **TDD** best practices
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges to build programs by using test driven development (TDD).

**EVIDENCE**
- Completed a challenge to use test drive a single-class **Diary Entry** program. [Link](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/05_test_drive_a_class/challenge)
- [Diagram of how to use *describe*, *context* and *it* in rspec](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning-journey/blob/main/diagrams/rspec-basics.jpg)
- DESIGN METHOD TEMPLATE 

--------------------------


### Goal 2: Learn to use basic **debugging** best practices
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on debugging.
**EVIDENCE**
- Learned about Discovery Debugging, completed challenge to debug a **Letter Counter** program with a pair partner. Used *p* and *binding.irb* to gain visibility. [Link](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/07_intermezzo_debugging_2)

--------------------------
### Goal 3: Explore and use **Object Orientated Programming (OOP)**
**PLAN**
- Complete Makers exercises and challenges on methods, classes and multiple class programs.
**EVIDENCE**
- Completed a challenge to use TDD to design a single-method program. [Link](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/03_design_a_single_method/challenge) / [Recording](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning-journey/blob/main/videos/week-1/phase_two_03_challenge.mp4)

- Challenge to use TTD to design a single-class program. [Link](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/06_design_a_class/challenge) / [Recording](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning-journey/blob/main/videos/week-1/phase_two_06_challenge.mp4)

--------------------------
### Goal 3: Learn to build software as a **pair**
**PLAN**
- Pair with a different person each afternoon for at least 3 hours.
**EVIDENCE**
- Completed the [Letter Counter](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/makers-projects/tree/main/week-1/phase-two/07_intermezzo_debugging_2) program with a pair.
- Lovely comments during first week retro.
- Positive feedback and messages from pair partners and requests to pair again in future.
--------------------------

### Reflection and feedback

**What went well**

During the first week I was paired with people who were behind me on the challenges. I was able to work with each pair partner and confidently explain most of the key concepts and terminology and help them move forward. This also gave me a great opportunity to reflect on what I had learned, identify gaps in my knowledge and address them.

Initially it seemed a bit odd to start a project by writing tests and no code. However, as I learned more and more about how to implement TDD effectively, I saw how extremely useful it is. It acts as another great way to break down a problem to smaller, more manageable problems and keeps you thinking very deliberately and methodically about what is going on and what your goals are.

**Even better if**
- Record my progress more regularly, not just at end of the week.
- Record at least one challenging thing per day to review and understand on the following day.
- Better boundaries set during pairing sessions. When to break and when to end.
