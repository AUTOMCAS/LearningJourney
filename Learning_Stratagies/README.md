## Learning Strategies

## Learning how to learn

Before the start of the course I decided that there was no better thing to do than to focus on **learning how to learn**. Coming from a background in Education I had a good idea of how to learn effectively, or so I thought! 

I read a number of books on the science of learning and problem solving. I discovered that while I had many good learning strategies, some of which were automatic, I still had a lot to learn about my own effective learning. 

I created a number of resources in which I outlined various key concepts of effective learning.

#### For example
- Identify learning objectives.
- Start with questions and read for answers.
- Regularly test yourself on recalling information to identify knowledge gaps.
- Review learning strategies to see what is working.
- Understand foundational principles and key concepts. These can be applied to larger scope.
- Celebrate challenges. Hard means you are learning!

Since starting the course I have continued to develop and apply these strategies to Software Development, reflecting and improving my personal learning strategies. This repository is a continuation of this development.

**Included in this repository:**
- Recording my development and implementation of various learning strategies.
- Reflection of what went well.
- Planning what to improve on.
