### Learning Strategy Review
### Precourse Week 1

What went well
- Testing happened largely through repeatedly needing to use the same code.
- Learning objectives were clearly set out by Makers documents.
- Pomadoros were only needed when focusing on learning. When focused on a task breaks can be further apart.


| What to improve on                                                                              | Action           |

| Try harder to recall information before looking for a solution.                                               | Take a moment to think before looking anything up|
| Need a strategy for reviewing extra questions and curiosities along the way.                    | Take notes of the questions on Google sheets file and review at end of day|
| Did not spend enough time reviewing concepts in a deliberate way through deeper reading.        | Note down key concepts as above and review |
| Develop a good routine.                                                                         | Define a start and end time to the day.       |
| Be aware of what you are trying to learn.                                                       | Refer to learning objectives often. |
