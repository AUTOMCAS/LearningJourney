## Precourse Week 4
Learning Strategy Review

&nbsp;

### What went well
- Starting to write questions for review that are about processes or concepts, not just lines of code.
- Added priority column to sort **Review Document** by importance. As I get more confident with the question, the priority decreases.
- Formatted **Review Document**
