# Chris Aston - Learning Journey
**This repository is a record of my learning journey through Makers Academy on my way to becoming a Software Developer.**

There are two distinct parts:

**[Learning Strategies](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning-journey/tree/main/learning-stratagies) - A record of my journey to better learn how to learn. The specific development of my learning strategies. This builds a foundation to be able to develop and improve any skill or area of knowledge.**

**[Progress Tracker](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning-journey/tree/main/progress-tracker) - A kind of a goal driven technical blog. My journey through Makers to become a Software Developer. Records my goals, strategies, achievements and reflections on how things went, personal experiences with pairing and various challenges along the way.**

These parts come together to fulfill my **long term goals** and inform my day to day approach.
