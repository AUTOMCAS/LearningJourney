# Chris Aston - Learning Journey
**This repository is a record of my learning journey through Makers Academy on my way to become a Software Developer.**

There are two distinct parts:

**[Learning Strategies](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/LearningJourney/tree/main/learning_stratagies) - The specific development of my learning strategies. This builds a foundation to be able to develop and improve any skill or area of knowledge.**

**[Progress Tracker](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/LearningJourney/tree/main/progress_tracker) - Kind of a goal driven technical blog. My journey through Makers to become a Software Developer. Records my goals, strategies, achievements and reflections on how things went, personal experiences with pairing and various challenges along the way.**

These parts come together to fulfill my long term goals and inform my day to day approach. 

***Perhaps include links below to various parts?***
